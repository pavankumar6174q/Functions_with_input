# Functions_with_input
so there are two kinds of functions simple functions and functions that take inputs. here is the example for that.

print("This is a simple function\n")


def greet():
  print("hello\n")
  print("how are you?\n")
  print("welcome to the website\n")
greet()

print("=====================================================================")

print("This is a function with input\n")


def greet_with_name(name):
  print(f"hello {name}\n")
  print(f"how are you {name}\n")
  print(f"welcome to the website {name}\n")
greet_with_name("tony stark")
